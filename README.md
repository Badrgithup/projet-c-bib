-Biblioth√®que ENSI Management System:
This project is a C programming course project focused on building a simple library management system using file handling, FIFO (First-In, First-Out) methods, and structures to organize and manage data. It demonstrates how to handle real-world problems like borrowing and returning books efficiently using structured programming.



-Features:


+Book Management:



Add new books to the library.
Display all books stored in bib.txt.
Search for a book by title using file handling.
Remove a book from the library.
Update the book's status (available or borrowed).

+Client Management:


Register new clients.


Display all registered clients stored in client.txt.
Search for a client by ID.



+Borrowing and Returning Books:


Borrow books by updating their status and tracking them in queues.

Return borrowed books, update their status, and manage the borrowing queues.


+FIFO Queue Implementation:


/The FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method is used to manage book borrowing:

*One queue tracks the borrowed books.

*Another queue tracks the clients who borrowed the books


-Objectives:

+Learn and apply structures to manage complex data.

+Utilize file handling for data persistence.

+Implement FIFO queues for practical borrowing processes.

+Develop a structured solution for real-world problems.
